mv toppar_drude_lipid_2013b_to_2017.str toppar_drude_lipid_2017a.str: 
   New Lipid force field of Hui et al.

   Major issue was the use of the CD32AL atom type due to a change in
   the CD32A CD32A CD32A CD32A dihedral parameter.  This leads to the
   treatment of this dihedral in the long alkanes and Lysine
   sidechains being modified.  The new dihedral parameters from the
   lipids have now been transferred to the proteins and tested by Jing
   Huang.  The changes are not significant based on Lys dipeptide
   simulations and the new parameters will be used in both the lipids
   and nucleic acids).

   Next generation lipids 
      1) based on dispersion PME
      2) will use nucleic acid phosphate model
      3) Unification of alkane parameters (protein FF is using new alkane parameters)
      4) consider unification of ester linkage model (residues MAS, MPRO etc)
      

New DNA parameters (Lemkul and MacKerell, JCTC, 2017, 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00067 and 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00068)

   residues BDEO and BRIB in nucleic_acid file changed to BDEON and BRIBN due to conflict with carbohydrates.
   RNA is NOT complete.

   toppar_drude_nucleic_acid_2017b.str is toppar_drude_nucleic_acid_2017a.str with selected RNA parameters removed
   to disallow its use for RNA simulations.

Test case issues

   Changes occurred in nucleic acids and carbohydrates.  Expected due
   to the 2017 DNA update and changes in the hexapyranose parameters.

   Some lipid model compounds to model test case. Additional residues add to lipid test case

   Additional residues in model test case, including molecular ions

Model compounds

   New Imidazole parameters from Fang-Yu Lin NOT added: will be released with the new protein FF.

   Alkenes from lipids to toppar_drude_model
   Carbonyl (ketone,aldehyde) from carbohydrates to toppar_drude_model

   Molecular ion atom types, residues and parameters added. 
       Parameters need to be finalized.
       Methylphosphates need additional optimization.
